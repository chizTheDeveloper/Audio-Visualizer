Required
• Frequency Detection and Volume UI/Info for Your Song toggled by spacebar
	- I made use of example showed in class
• (3) frequency ranges (instruments chosen) and tracked clearly
	- I have a drum (red circle) , guiter(white circle lines) and hi-hat(green circle)
• Elements that react to frequency
	- The side bars react to guiter frequency
• Elements that react to Volume
	-The shpere in the middle reacts to volume
• A visual progression/narrative matching song’s progression
	- I have a rectangle that appears fully when the base drop


Recommended
• Create multiple “scenes” that highlight the different progressions or themes found in songs (e.g. should the chorus or climax be the
same scene as the introductory phrases)
	- Things activate based on  when instrument becomes present in the song.

• Add some basic interactions so that the experience isn’t just passive
	-I include a ghost that flys around and occasionally disppear to a sound
